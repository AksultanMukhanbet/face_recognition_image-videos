# face_recognition_image-videos
In this project guide, you will learn how to use a neural network for face recognition. To build our face recognition system, we will first perform face detection, extract the face attachments from each face using deep learning, train the attachment face recognition model, and then finally recognize faces in both images and video streams using OpenCV.
